;;; Commentary:

;; Provides a transient-based UI for responding to permission requests
;; from the opencode server.  Press o to accept once, a to accept
;; always (showing the patterns that will be permanently approved),
;; or n to deny.
;;
;; Dismissing the transient without responding (e.g. q or C-g) leaves
;; the request pending.  Re-open it later with `opencode-respond-permission'.
