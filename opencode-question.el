;;; Commentary:

;; Provides a transient-based UI for answering questions from the opencode
;; server.  Supports single-select, multiple-select, and custom typed answers.
;;
;; Each option is a numbered key in the transient popup.  Press the key
;; to toggle the option.  Confirm with C-c C-c, reject with q.
;;
;; The transient directly calls the server API on confirm or reject,
;; avoiding `recursive-edit' which conflicts with transient key handling.
